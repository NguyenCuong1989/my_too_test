     3	## Rules
     4	- Decisions are append-only; numbered states (R-xx) are authoritative.
     5	- No silent changes; explicit promote criteria required.
     6	- Context version v1.0, lock level HARD; updates require new block and approval.

     8	## Phases

    10	- Phase 2: commands on explicit request
    11
    12	## Invariants

    14	- Every action logged and replayable
    15	- AI never bypasses policy; human override always wins
    16
    17	## Change Control
    18	- Promote flow controlled (already defined in ops)
    19	- Public bundle export at spec level only
