# SYSTEM SCOPE (CANON)

AXCONTROL-owned code (Canon-enforced):
- core/
- apps/
- scripts/
- ops/

Out of scope (no Canon enforcement):
- ui/node_modules/, ui/dist/, vendor/3rd-party artifacts
- External/legacy components not authored by AXCONTROL

Rule: Non-conforming external code is excluded from local runtime; Canon is not relaxed to accommodate it.
