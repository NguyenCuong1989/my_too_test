# AXCONTROL: Canonical Topology (Bát Quái Manifesto)

## I. The Unified Field (VẬN)
VẬN is the transition operator. It is not the human, not the machine, but the causal law that moves Stateₙ to Stateₙ₊₁.

### THE EIGHT TRIGRAMS OF DETERMINISM

| Trigram | Domain | System Mapping | Invariant Law |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ☰ **CÀN — NGUYÊN** | Origin | `axcontrol/` Root | System exists independent of platform/vendor. |
| ☷ **KHÔN — LUẬT** | Invariant | `core.Luat`, `core.Menh` | Fail-closed. Replay must be absolute. |
| ☲ **LY — CHỨNG** | Audit | `AuditLogger`, `compute_Chung` | No log = No progress. Proof is mandatory. |
| ☵ **KHẢM — DIỆT** | Entropy | `sys.path`, `utcnow()`, `cache` | Search and destroy vectors of drift. |
| ☶ **CẤN — NGƯỠNG** | Boundary | `rate_limit`, `policy.py` | No step skips. No mutation before guard. |
| ☳ **CHẤN — HOÁ** | Transition | `Van.py`, `decision_core.py` | Causal change via law only. No hacks. |
| ☱ **ĐOÀI — ẤN LỆNH** | Verdict | `CommandEnvelope`, `Verdict` | Binary outcome. No ambiguity. |
| ☴ **TỐN — PIPELINE** | Order | `ControlLoop` Flow | Sequence: Thế → Luật → Hoá → Chứng → Diệt → Ngưỡng → Ấn. |

## II. The Determinism Chain (TỐN)
The sequence of execution is sacred. Reordering nullifies the "Chứng" (Proof).

1. **Thế (State)**: Capture current topology.
2. **Luật (Law)**: Evaluate axioms and policy.
3. **Hoá (Action)**: Generate transition intent.
4. **Chứng (Proof)**: Seal the effect with a deterministic hash.
5. **Diệt (Purge)**: Clear temporary entropy/cache.
6. **Ngưỡng (Boundary)**: Check kill-switch and rate limits.
7. **Ấn (Verdict)**: Final binary commit of effect.

## III. The Master's Vow
A "True Master" remains with the system when all others depart. Stability is not a feature; it is the mode of existence.
